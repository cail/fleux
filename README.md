Fleux
======

Fleux is a simple UI engine that provides a fluid touch friendly experience and is written on .net
It includes an Animation framework, Gestures, and nice controls.

Fleux was originally created by Jose Gallarado at fleux.codeplex.com for Windows Mobile platform.

But the original code was abadoned.

This fork is a continuation of the original project.

The main difference points are:

- Fleux now runs on Windows Mobile, WindowsCE, Windows XP/Vista/7 and Linux seamlessly.
  This means you don't have to change a single line in your code to create a truly portable app.

- Fleux runs on Android (on top of great Xamarin's Mono Android product)
  With minimal hooks this allows you to have a single codebase for your app, running on multiple platforms.

The main application of this framework is github.com/cail/hobd project for now.
